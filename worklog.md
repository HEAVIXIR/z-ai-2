# HEAVIX - Development Worklog

This file tracks all development progress for the HEAVIX project in this sandbox.
Each new agent/task appends a section below (separated by `---`).

---

Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Orchestrator (Z.ai Code)
Task: Initial project intake — extract HEAVIX zips, git init+commit, install PostgreSQL, migrate SQLite → PostgreSQL, then proceed to Phase 12 (Admin Control Plane Foundation).

Work Log:
- Inspected current sandbox state: a fresh Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Prisma + SQLite scaffold with `User` and `Post` models. shadcn/ui components already present.
- User attempted to upload 4 HEAVIX zip files via gateway. Gateway metadata reported file delivery to `/home/z/my-project/upload/`, but the upload folder is provably empty (`mtime = 1970-01-01`, `Birth = -`). User re-uploaded file4.zip multiple times; never arrived. Confirmed gateway file-delivery is broken for this session (likely due to spaces in filename "heavix selected file4.zip").
- Searched entire filesystem: no `*heavix*` files, no recently-created zip files. The 4 uploaded zips are inaccessible.
- Discovered platform auto-initialised git: `35bf725 Initial commit` + `5c3f2f8 ...` (auto-checkpoint). Made an explicit milestone commit for clarity.
- Installed PostgreSQL 17.11 as user-space install (no sudo):
  - `apt-get download postgresql-17 postgresql-client-17 postgresql-common postgresql-client-common` (no root needed for download)
  - Extracted .deb files with `dpkg-deb -x` into `/home/z/pg`
  - `initdb -D /home/z/pgdata -U heavix --auth-local=trust --auth-host=trust`
  - Fixed socket dir issue: default `/var/run/postgresql/` not writable → set `unix_socket_directories = '/home/z/pgdata/socket'`
  - Started server on port 5432, listening on `localhost` + Unix socket
  - Created database `heavix` owned by user `heavix`
- Set up env management:
  - Discovered platform sets `DATABASE_URL=file:/home/z/my-project/db/custom.db` as a system env var (overriding `.env`)
  - Created `scripts/with-env.sh` — a tiny bash wrapper that reads `.env` and EXPORTS variables with high priority, then `exec`s the command. This bypasses the platform's system env override.
  - Updated `package.json` so `dev`, `build`, `start`, `db:*` scripts all run through `./scripts/with-env.sh`. Added `pg:start`, `pg:stop`, `pg:status` helpers.
  - Updated `.env` to use `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://heavix@localhost:5432/heavix?schema=public`; kept original SQLite URL as `SQLITE_SOURCE_URL` for migration reference.
- Migrated schema from SQLite to PostgreSQL:
  - Updated `prisma/schema.prisma`: `provider = "sqlite"` → `provider = "postgresql"`, added `binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]`
  - Ran `db:push`: `User` and `Post` tables created in PostgreSQL (verified via `psql \dt`)
- Wrote `scripts/migrate-sqlite-to-postgres.ts` using `bun:sqlite` + Prisma Client. Reads all rows from SQLite and upserts into PostgreSQL. Handles SQLite's `0/1` boolean encoding. Idempotent.
- Ran migration: 0 rows migrated (SQLite `db/custom.db` has only schema, no data) — mechanism verified. When actual HEAVIX SQLite db arrives, the script can be re-run unchanged.
- Restarted dev server with new env: killed old `next dev` (PIDs 1167/1170/1189), started new one via `nohup ./scripts/with-env.sh bun run dev`. Confirmed HTTP 200 from `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Made git commit `9bcb2e1`: "feat: HEAVIX - PostgreSQL migration (Phase 11 complete)".
- Created backup zip: `/home/z/my-project/download/heavix-backup-stage1-postgres.zip` (77 MB — includes .deb packages, scripts, prisma schema, .env, source code).

Stage Summary:
- ✅ Step 2 (git init+commit): Done (platform auto-init + explicit milestone commit `9bcb2e1`).
- ✅ Step 3 (install PostgreSQL): Done — PostgreSQL 17.11 user-space, port 5432, db `heavix` created, server running.
- ✅ Step 4 (migrate SQLite → PostgreSQL): Schema migrated (User, Post tables in PostgreSQL). Migration script ready to re-run when real HEAVIX SQLite db arrives. Data migration pending because the HEAVIX zip with the actual SQLite db has not been delivered by the gateway.
- ⏳ Step 1 (extract zips): BLOCKED — gateway did not deliver the 4 uploaded zip files to `/home/z/my-project/upload/`. User has been asked to rename files (remove spaces) and re-upload.
- ⏳ Step 5 (Phase 12 — Admin Control Plane Foundation): Starting next.

Key artifacts produced:
- `/home/z/pg/` — PostgreSQL 17 install (extracted .deb)
- `/home/z/pgdata/` — Database cluster + socket
- `/home/z/my-project/scripts/with-env.sh` — env override wrapper
- `/home/z/my-project/scripts/pg-start.sh`, `pg-stop.sh`, `pg-status.sh` — cluster management
- `/home/z/my-project/scripts/migrate-sqlite-to-postgres.ts` — reusable migration script
- `/home/z/my-project/.env` — PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL (with SQLite source kept)
- `/home/z/my-project/prisma/schema.prisma` — provider=postgresql
- `/home/z/my-project/download/heavix-backup-stage1-postgres.zip` — stage 1 backup

Unresolved / risks:
- Gateway file delivery is broken for this session. Until resolved, the actual HEAVIX source/schema/data cannot be loaded. The user has been asked to:
  1. Rename `heavix selected file4.zip` → `heavix-file4.zip` (no spaces) and re-upload.
  2. If still fails, paste Phase 12 plan / HEAVIX schema inline.
- Phase 12 will be built based on the standard "Admin Control Plane" definition (user mgmt, roles, audit logs, feature flags, system settings, metrics dashboard). Once the real HEAVIX spec arrives, refinements can be made.
- The platform's system `DATABASE_URL` env var still shadows `.env`; the `with-env.sh` wrapper is the workaround. Future agents MUST use `./scripts/with-env.sh` prefix for any prisma/next command.
- PostgreSQL must be re-started after a sandbox reset: `bun run pg:start` (or directly `/home/z/my-project/scripts/pg-start.sh`).
