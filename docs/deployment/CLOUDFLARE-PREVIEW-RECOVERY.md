# HEAVIX Cloudflare Preview Recovery

## Scope

This change repairs the missing OpenNext project configuration so Cloudflare
Workers Builds can attempt a reproducible adapter build for HEAVIX.

It is a **build-only compatibility experiment**. It does not enable preview
deployments, alter Worker secrets or bindings, attach routes/domains, change
DNS, migrate data, or affect the Docker production path.

## Evidence that prompted this change

The Cloudflare Workers Build log for
`097e07f3-1d80-447d-9512-dc3017a8c888` stopped with:

```text
Error: No `open-next.config.ts` file was found in the project root.
This file is required for OpenNext Cloudflare builds.
```

The Cloudflare build configuration also currently has:
- `previews_enabled = false`
- a preview deploy command that intentionally prints
  `HEAVIX_PREVIEW_DEPLOY_BLOCKED_PENDING_ARTIFACT_AND_DATABASE_ISOLATION_PROOF`

Those deployment guards are intentionally preserved.

## Configuration

- `open-next.config.ts` selects the Cloudflare OpenNext adapter with its
  default configuration. No unverified cache, queue, or R2 integration is
  enabled.
- `wrangler.jsonc` describes the expected OpenNext Worker entry point and
  static asset binding, using the existing Worker name and compatibility date.
- `.open-next/` and `.wrangler/` are generated artifacts and are ignored by Git.

## Acceptance gates

1. Cloudflare Workers Build completes the OpenNext build step.
2. Build artifacts and route manifest are inspected.
3. Static assets, App Router routes, Route Handlers, middleware, image handling,
   and server-only dependencies are checked for Worker compatibility.
4. Both PostgreSQL clients are proven to use isolated non-production databases.
5. Authentication, session handling, RBAC, security headers, and error paths
   pass runtime smoke tests in a non-production Worker.
6. Only after all gates pass may a separate decision enable a preview deployment.

A successful adapter build is **not** proof of runtime compatibility and is not
a production release approval.
