# HEAVIX Worklog

Append-only session log. Keep exact evidence and distinguish completed from unverified.

## 2026-11-11 — Durable cross-chat / cross-agent handoff

- Repository: `HEAVIXIR/z-ai-2`.
- Branch: `recovery/heavix-full-product-integration-2026-11-11`.
- Added mandatory continuation protocol: `docs/operations/HEAVIX-AGENT-CONTINUATION.md`.
- Added machine-readable checkpoint: `docs/operations/HEAVIX-CURRENT-STATE.json`.
- This worklog created to ensure future agents append factual progress rather than relying on chat memory.
- Existing verified findings and exact next action are copied into the state document and continuation protocol.
- No application code changed in this session.
- No CI run, Preview deploy, database inspection/write, Production change, or DNS change was performed in this session.
- Important: do not mark homepage restoration complete. The next implementation action is specified in `HEAVIX-CURRENT-STATE.json`.
- Commit resulting from this checkpoint: to be recorded immediately after GitHub confirms the create-file commits.

## 2026-11-11 — Homepage public-read safety remediation

- Re-verified the active recovery branch and read the mandatory continuation protocol, checkpoint and worklog before editing.
- Confirmed current src/app/page.tsx still renders only the five-widget PageRenderer fallback and the PageRenderer registry currently exposes ten widget types; the 17 legacy keys are section/domain components, not 17 existing PageRenderer widgets.
- Inspected the legacy homepage implementation. It performs multiple writes during public page rendering (seed defaults, create missing sections, and deactivate a duplicate brands section); it must not be copied wholesale into the new route.
- Confirmed HomePageSection schema is an editable configuration table with unique key, order, active, and JSON-string config.
- Changed src/app/api/homepage-sections/route.ts to a strictly read-only public GET: no auto-seed/createMany, safe JSON config parsing, and a generic 503 response on DB failure.
- Added tests/security/homepage-sections-readonly.test.ts with handler-level tests for populated results, empty DB/no seed side effect, and safe DB failure response.
- Source commit: a1401c5700773b5322262045b7a01f9917e6301d.
- Test commit: 668af8677cc4f0857a10b81a2232426dcef5cb63.
- CI workflow inspection: .github/workflows/ci.yml runs on pull requests targeting main; it does not deploy Cloudflare. No CI result has been observed yet.
- Not performed: no local test execution (repository runtime is not mounted in this session), no PR created yet, no Cloudflare build/deploy, no DB access/write, no Production or DNS change.
- Next: create a draft PR to trigger repository CI, inspect its result, then implement the canonical homepage section adapter without porting legacy request-time writes.

## 2026-11-11 — Full homepage section composition restored in source

- Restored the original HEAVIX homepage composition in src/app/page.tsx using the existing current-tree home components and the legacy section orchestration as a read-only reference.
- Reinstated all 17 canonical section keys: hero, categories, hot-searches, stats, recommendations, verified-machines, featured-machines, active-requests, exclusive-sale, services, latest-ads, sell7, why-us, brands, trusted-brands, knowledge, cta.
- Extracted the canonical defaults/merge logic to src/lib/homepage/sections.ts. Existing database rows remain authoritative; explicit active=false settings are preserved; missing defaults are supplied in memory only and never written during a public request.
- Removed legacy request-time HomePageSection createMany/create/update/deactivation behavior from the homepage route. A source scan of src/app/page.tsx found zero Prisma mutation calls.
- Removed the legacy hard-coded 31-province statistic. StatsSection now receives only admin-configured real SiteStat values; hero metrics continue to use live database counts.
- Added tests/unit/homepage-sections.test.ts for the 17-key canonical registry, merge behavior, preserved admin configuration, and empty-table fallback.
- Removed an unused verified-listing aggregate query from the restored route.
- Implementation commits: 874132e7bea4ab2af3d1c1620d97fab22d35fd3f (homepage restoration), 744917e259365de55d90a64338810924b62627d9 (pure composition helper extraction), b17244026f3a54f9bc9dfc7b09cadb81568025c7 (helper file), fa50d99b0afa0f654e8349bc180e8bab58495247 (unit tests), 701016644ebe1a170a89ee4a3a31dff29869c9bd (unused query removal).
- Review note: the homepage now uses the legacy-compatible HomePageSection orchestration and current components. PageRenderer/PageBuilder remain available for custom pages/preview flows; the root homepage no longer lets an incomplete generic five-widget layout suppress the canonical product homepage.
- Validation state: source-level checks confirm 17 section switch cases and zero Prisma write calls in src/app/page.tsx. The full GitHub Actions run for the earlier checkpoint is in progress; a newer run is expected for this latest commit. No successful build/typecheck/test claim yet.
- No Preview deployment, Cloudflare build, database access/write, Production change, or DNS change was performed.
- Next: monitor CI for the latest PR head, fix every type/test/build failure, then continue route/API/RBAC audits for Store, Companies, Sell in 7 Days, Services, Knowledge and Admin. Do not deploy until DB identity and artifact gates pass.
